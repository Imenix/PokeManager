        It is said in many Sinnoh legends that the universe, Pokémon world
        included, was created by a single Pokémon, Arceus. In a void of
        nothingness, a single Egg came into being, which then hatched into
        Arceus. Arceus creates Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina and gives Dialga and
        Palkia the abilities to control time and space. Giratina is banished
        into another dimension for its behavior. Then, during very early
        formation of the world, possibly sooner, Arceus creates Azelf, Uxie, and
        Mesprit to create willpower, knowledge, and emotion, respectively,
        attributes that are in all modern humans and Pokémon. After the
        formation of the Sinnoh region, they dive to the bottom of present-day
        Lake Valor, Lake Acuity, and Lake Verity, respectively, dubbing the term
        "the lake guardians." Also in these early times, Mew appeared on the
        planet, containing the DNA of every Pokémon. There are many scientists
        who believe that Mew was the ancestor of all Pokémon
